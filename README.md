# Urban-Escape-game
Hello!  

Here is a simple Java game. We were inspired by popular game "Vector". Project was made by 3 developers: Kalianova Mariia, Krasovskyy Andrii, Tarasenko Mykhailo.

All graphics and design was created using Adobe Illustrator. Game is written with Java language. Game uses graphics, transitions and music.  

You can see the report in files (in Ukrainian) and the video, which presents this game.  

This project was done during education in Kyiv-Mohyla Acasemy.
